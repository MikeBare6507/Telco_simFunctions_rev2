# Telco_simFunctions_rev2
This is the second revision of simulation functions
The first was a bit more rudimentary and experimental. This new set is more closely aligned with the phenomena it seeks to simulate. In the real world, "accuracy" is a function of a) change events that need to be tracked, and b) diligence in tracking events, the simulation needs to involve features for each component. In a sense a) change events can be thought of as equipment failure rates (not entirely though) and b) diligence can be thought of as the responsible party's diligence in tracking the changes. For this reason, part of the simulation needs to operate on change events (partly a function of time) and another part needs to work on "diligence". Diligence, will need to be a negative function operating against change events. That is, a diligent party will track more change events and therefore in the simulation will counteract data generation on the basis of change events (since the final values will be based on discrepancies where the data generated in the simulation is actually treated as the source of TRUTH -- i.e., the accurate inventory (even though it is a sample)).
